============

Sample Application using VIN Vault API

This is a sample application using the [vinvault.com](http://www.vinvault.com) VIN decoding API.  It requires an account to be able to use the service.

Once you have an account replace the placeholder with your API authentication token.  The token is in the `Constants.h` file.

```
#define VINVAULT_TOKEN @"REPLACE_ME"
```

**Note that this project uses the [CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org) dependency library.  Open the project with the `VIN Vault Sample Application.xcworkspace` file instead of the project file.**
